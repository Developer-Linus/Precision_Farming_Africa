# Story
I'm sitting here, thinking about a scenario where food is a challenge. My thoughts begin to wander: *Who created these plants that provide us with nutrients and sustain our lives?*
Whoever created the plants that give us food made a truly wise decision. I can't help but deeply appreciate the incredible work accomplished.

Every time I enjoy my favorite meal, the taste elevates my sense of gratitude—gratitude to the creator of the plants that produced what I’m eating.

Then comes a group of individuals we call farmers. They’re the ones who put in the hard work to ensure our food crops grow well, from seedlings all the way to harvest. Shout out to all the farmers out there! I understand the challenges you go through every day.

With the skills I’ve gained from ALX, I’m building a **Precision Farming API platform** just for you. A platform that will provide real-time updates to help you grow the food we all depend on.
# Overview
The Precision Farming API will enable farmers to:
* **Authenticate securely** to access personalized farm data.
* **Receive real-time updates** on soil moisture, weather, and crop health.
* **Use a mobile-first responsive design** for accessibility on low-end smartphones.
* **Integrate with IoT sensors** via RESTful APIs for data collection.
* **Manage content** (e.g., farm profiles, sensor data) via an admin dashboard.
# Challenges
1. In this project, I aimed to containerize **Django** and **PostgreSQL** using `docker-compose`. The issue arose when I installed Docker on my Ubuntu OS — there was no connection between the installed OS and the Docker extension. It took me a while to figure out how to establish the connection.

After trying multiple solutions without success, I finally turned to the **Docker documentation** as my last resort. Digging deeper, I discovered the root of the problem: I needed to install **Docker Desktop** and configure it properly so that the extension could detect it.
> **Lesson Learned**: Never underestimate the value of official documentation when working on software projects. It can save you time and allow you to focus on other critical development tasks.
